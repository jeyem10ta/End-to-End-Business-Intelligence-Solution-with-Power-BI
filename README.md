# AdventureWorks Dataset Project

# Overview

This project utilizes the AdventureWorks dataset to perform data cleaning, modeling, and visualization using Power Query and Power BI. AdventureWorks is a sample database provided by Microsoft that simulates a fictional bicycle manufacturer and retailer.

# Data Cleaning

Data cleaning was performed using Power Query in Microsoft Excel. This involved identifying and addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers in the dataset to ensure data quality and integrity.

# Data Modeling

After cleaning the data, it was modeled to create relationships between different tables, enabling efficient data analysis and visualization. The data model was designed to provide insights into various aspects of the business, including sales, products, customers, and regions.

# Data Visualization

Data visualization was carried out using Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool by Microsoft. The cleaned and modeled data was visualized through interactive dashboards and reports, allowing stakeholders to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.
